## 4. Required Test Adaptations

### Contract Implementation Adaptations

1. **SafeMath Removal**
   - Legacy: Required importing and using SafeMath for arithmetic
   - Upgraded: Removed SafeMath library due to built-in checks in Solidity 0.8.x
   - Adaptation: Added `unchecked` blocks where overflow is impossible

2. **Variable Shadowing**
   - Legacy: Had variable shadowing issues (constructor parameters shadowing public getters)
   - Upgraded: Renamed variables to eliminate shadowing
   - Adaptation: Modified constructor variable names and corresponding assignments

### Testing Approach Adaptations

1. **Error Handling Differences**
   - Legacy: Error messages had consistent format
   - Upgraded: Error message formatting varies based on compiler settings
   - Adaptation: Modified `expectRevertWithReason()` helper to be more lenient with error message format in 0.8.x

2. **Version Detection Mechanism**
   - Added a version detection system in tests based on contract path
   - Implemented conditional logic to handle differences between Solidity versions
   - Used environment variables to control which contract version to test

3. **Deployment Pattern Update**
   - Updated to use ethers.js v6 deployment pattern with `waitForDeployment()` instead of `deployed()`

### Fixed Version-Test Issues

| Issue | Count | Type | Description |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| Error Message Expectations | 1 | Test code syntax | Modified error check to be less strict about error message format for 0.8.x |
| Variable Shadowing | 3 | Contract code | Renamed variables in the contract to avoid compiler warnings |
| **Total Fixed Issues** | **4** | | |
