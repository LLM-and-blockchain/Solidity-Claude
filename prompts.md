## Upgrading and testing

Upgrade this smart contract written in Solidity to the latest pragma version (0.8.20), ensuring that the function interfaces remain identical.  
The project is structured with two separate contract folders ('legacy' and 'upgraded') where contracts maintain the same name in both folders but use different compiler versions.  
Develop a single set of unit tests in a .js file that can be used to verify the semantic correctness of both contract versions without any modifications.  
The tests must be compatible with both versions since the function declarations are the same, but should account for any changes in internal behavior or error mechanics between Solidity versions.  
The project is configured with the following package.json dependencies:  

```
"devDependencies": { 
    "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox": "^5.0.0", 
    "hardhat": "^2.22.19" 
  } 
```

Structure the tests using the following pattern:  
1. Implement an environment variable configuration (CONTRACT_VERSION) to control which contract version to test  
2. Use fully qualified contract names to reference the specific contract files  
3. Create a version detection mechanism that automatically adapts tests to the appropriate Solidity version  
4. Use the current ethers v6 deployment pattern with waitForDeployment() instead of deployed()  
5. Include conditional test logic that can handle different error mechanisms between Solidity versions. 

The test file should follow this general structure:  
```
describe("Contract Tests", function () { 
  // Array of contract fully qualified names to test 
  const contractVersions = []; 
  // Determine which contract(s) to test based on environment variable 
  const requestedVersion = process.env.CONTRACT_VERSION; 
  if (requestedVersion === "legacy") { 
    contractVersions.push("contracts/legacy/legacy_contract_name.sol:ContractName"); 
  } else if (requestedVersion === "upgraded") { 
    contractVersions.push("contracts/upgraded/upgraded_contract_name.sol:ContractName"); 
  } else { 

    // If no specific version is requested, test both 
    contractVersions.push("contracts/legacy/legacy_contract_name.sol:ContractName"); 
    contractVersions.push("contracts/upgraded/upgraded_contract_name.sol:ContractName"); 
  } 

  // Helper functions if needed  
  // Run the same tests for each contract version 

  contractVersions.forEach(contractName => { 
    describe(`Testing ${contractName}`, function() { 
      let contractInstance; 
      …. 

      // Version detection helper 
      function detectSolidityVersion() { 
        isSolidity8OrHigher = contractName.includes("upgraded"); 
      } 

      beforeEach(async function () { 
        [owner, account1, account2] = await ethers.getSigners(); 
        detectSolidityVersion(); 
        const ContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory(contractName); 
        contractInstance = await ContractFactory.deploy(/* constructor params */); 
        await contractInstance.waitForDeployment(); 
      }); 

      // Test cases with version-specific adaptations as needed 
    }); 
  }); 
}); 
```
Each test should verify that both versions of the contract maintain identical behavior from a user perspective, while adapting to 
internal implementation differences between Solidity versions. 


## Report generation


Based on the implementation of both the legacy and upgraded smart contracts and their corresponding test results, generate a comprehensive technical report that includes:
  

1. A detailed changelog documenting all modifications between the legacy and upgraded contract versions, including: 

   - Syntax and language feature updates necessitated by the Solidity version change 

   - Security improvements and vulnerability mitigations 

   - Gas optimization techniques applied 

   - The technical rationale justifying each significant change 

  

2. A quantitative analysis of functionality, including: 

   - Total count of functions implemented in the legacy contract 

   - Total count of functions implemented in the upgraded contract 

   - Any new capabilities introduced in the upgraded version 

   - Verification that all legacy functionalities remain accessible through identical interfaces 

  

3. A test coverage assessment: 

   - Count of functionalities successfully tested in the legacy version 

   - Count of functionalities successfully tested in the upgraded version 

   - Description of any version-specific test adjustments required: if referred to the contract code implementation or if referred to test code sintax 

   - Analysis of edge cases and how they were handled differently between versions 

  

4. A concise executive summary highlighting the most significant changes and their impact on contract security, efficiency, and maintainability.
